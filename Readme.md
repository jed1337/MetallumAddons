# Keyboard shortcuts for [metal-archives.com](metal-archives.com/)  
## Description  
The shortcuts in this project were created to make the site easier to use as well as for me to practise my Javascript. It focuses on the site's artist and album page. It also provides shortcuts for general use.  

Metal-archives has already included [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) in its code. Including it again within the script causes the site to have problems and the shortcuts to not function.

Feel free to improve this project or offer up some suggestions.
